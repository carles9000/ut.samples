<code>Scenario: Imagine a process that initializes an object that can create a connection each time it is run. 
This initialization can take a few seconds. Once the connection is established, I retrieve data and return the information to the client.
<br><br>UT creates a 60-second keep-alive connection by default. This means that the connection we created the first time remains open for this amount of time.
We will use the UDataKeepAlive( [bInit] ) function to retrieve a variable of any type, including an object. If it does not exist, the <bInit> 
codeblock is executed to initialize the variable.
In this example, the first time we connect, the connection will not exist, and it will be initialized, returning the object. 
<br><br>We then manipulate the object, in this case retrieving data. Subsequently, we connect within the 60-second persistence period, 
the system will collect the same object and return it without having to create a new connection, increasing system performance.
<br><br>If no new requests are executed, the object will self-destruct.	
<br><br>Summary: The first execution will take approximately 2 seconds to respond. Subsequent executions will be instantaneous!
